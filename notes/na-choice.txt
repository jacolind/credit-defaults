# a lot of NA in our X varibales. how should we handle that? qq

# choice 1 is the one currently implemented

# choice 1:
# in the fitting step, ingore rows where any columns is NA (i.e. fit on "complete cases"). Then, in the predicting step, replace the NA in X with zero and use that data with the model to predict.
# in addition, only use numerical X variables

# choice 2:
# NA handled as in choice 1
# in addition, use numerical and categorical variables

# choice 3:
# replace NA with the column mean or median
# the mean kan be imputed in the training set, and ev. also in the testing set.

# choice 4:
# replace NA with the "clustered mean". so first use some clustering algorithm to group observations together. then whenever there is an NA in row N column K look at the cluster that N belongs to, and impute that clusters mean value for kolumn K into the cell (N,K).
# the mean kan be imputed in the training set, and ev. also in the testing set.

# choice 5:
# handle NA differently for different columns, based on our business knowledge. by looking at the names of the variables I see that some are related, e.g. account_status and account_worst_status (0-3m 12-24m )
na.
